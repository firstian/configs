# An example of how to set up mulitple account access for AWS CLI

# The default profile is the one that requires no additional argument
# and thus should be a sand option. In this case, it's the sandbox
# account. Everything is tied together by the sso_session name.

sso_session = my_sso_session
sso_account_id = XXXXXXXXXXXX
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess

# This is the profile for the admin account. It is used with the flag
# --profile admin with all the aws commands
[profile admin]
sso_session = my_sso_session
sso_account_id = YYYYYYYYYY
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess

# This is the SSO session used for all the accounts in the org. This is
# set up by "aws configure sso"

# each account in the org, for as many account as we need.
